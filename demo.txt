Use salt as an abrasive and absorber when cleaning. I spray my stove top with a general household cleaner then sprinkle salt liberally over the top. It gets grease out easily...For liquid stains like wine, I pour salt over the stain to soak up excess liquid then come through with hydrogen peroxide. Finally I get absorbent towels and dab clean it.

Scuba diver here.  Instead of using those expensive defogger gels and sprays on your mask, smear a bunch of dish soap in it, rinse once or twice, and your mask will never fog during the dive...You can also use this method to keep your windshield from fogging.  Smear a bunch of dish soap on a towel, then rub it all over the inside of your windshield.  Take another damp towel and rub the soap off until your wind shield is clear.  I did this 3 weeks ago and have not had to defog a single time since.

Bleach to keep away cockroaches.  I used to get big ass cockroaches in the summer that came up my drain...My exterminator told me to pour 1 cup of bleach down my drain each week.  You have to pour it down the drain in the room you see them.  I started 18 months ago and haven't seen a cockroach since.

Clear nail polish:..* Prevent skin going green from brass.* Permanently stop fabric from fraying.   * Same goes with yarn.* Seal paint..The $2 quick dry stuff is the best for me.

Any cooking oil is a great way to remove the residue from stickers. ..Idk if this is recommended but if you get scratches on wood furniture I've always taken a matching washable marker, colored over the scratch, and then wiped it with a damp cloth (to effectively stain the wood back to match).

If you have a French press for coffee, you can also froth milk in it after. Pour in hot milk and raise and lower the plunger until the volume of the milk has about doubled...Not my channel, but plugging for [James Hoffman](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMb0O2CdPBNi-QqPk5T3gsQ). If you like coffee, and want to explore the utter depths of the world of coffee, coffee gear, coffee science in a super chill and informative way, check him out!

Liquid Laundry detergent glows under blacklights but is clear under normal light. You can dip a qtip in some detergent and draw/write on your walls and only see it with a blacklight on. Different brands glow different colors. Lots of fun in dorm rooms.

Condensed milk for those with chronic vomiting. Not only is it great for cooking, but I had a pharmacist tell me about adding some water till it is the consistency of thick soup. Get the person to sip small amounts of it slowly. It helps line the oesophagus to reduce vomiting, and allowing medication time to hit the stomach and work. Also provides much needed sugar. I’ve used it on kids and adults and it’s worked a treat every time.

Hair conditioner as shaving cream..Edit: I am only buying a cheap $1-2 bottle of cheap conditioner used specifically for shaving. A big bottle will last for months. I’m only using it for legs and under arms, but I see other have success using for facial hair and shaving their heads as well.

Anal Eaze is good for a toothache, and it's cherry flavored. (I work at an adult store. Also, please don't use Anal Eaze for anal if you are having painful anal sex. Get some butt plugs and a good lube. Just because you can't feel your sensitive areas being damaged doesn't mean they aren't being damaged.)

Vinegar is amazing. It can be used as a cheap household cleaner, refresh the coffee maker, and it can cure foot fungus and jock itch.

If you have pets, spray a mixture ( 2 or 3 to 1 ) of water to fabric softener on carpet and let it dry before vacuuming. You'll be amazed how much pet hair gets picked up. Bonus, it smells awesome.

I wrap those thick rubber bands (you know the ones that come around broccoli crowns) around tight jar lids to make them grippy and easy to undo...Edit: Wow, muchas gracias for the gold and silver! You all are some fine people. And hopefully less troubled by tight lids from now on (lots of great tips in the comments too).

Pickle juice can assist the ph balance in your stomach. This means when out drinking, if your stomach starts to feel queezy take a shot or two of pickle juice... why vomit when you’re out having fun?..On a side and probably more relevant note, pickle juice is essentially the OG Gatorade. If you need to replace electrolytes or simply feel a bit dehydrated, drink some pickle juice and then some water.

Adolph's Meat Tenderizer is an excellent treatment for bee stings, mosquito bites, portuguese man-o-war, and no-see-ums...Most venomous bites/stings will be less inflamed if you grind in a few wet crystals of Adolph's very soon after...Not fire ants, though.

Go to your local hardware store and have them cut you a 2-3 foot long piece of galvanized tubing (typically used for chain link fences) and keep it in your trunk. If you get a flat and are relying on the standard equipment that comes with your vehicle to change the tire, the lug nut wrench is notoriously small and it's hard to get leverage on tight lug nuts. Put the wrench on the leg nut, put the steel tubing over the end of the wrench, and pull. You'll have leverage x 100 and the bolts will easily come loose.

Leftover used Bounce sheets are good little scrubbies for dishes, especially greasy pots and pans. Because they don't scratch, they're free (because they already served their original purpose) and when they're all gunky you can throw them away.

Pantyhose for pool filtering...This is pretty random, but... Women's knee-high pantyhose stretches to fit perfectly around the return pipe in an above-ground pool. For the itty-bitty particles (our problem was gnats!) that manage to make it through the filter, a single knee-high pantyhose sock will catch everything that would otherwise be returned into the water. It can be bunched up on the pipe so it's not very intrusive. Cheap enough to throw away when it's dirty, easy to replace. A 6-pack for $3 got us through the summer and we had to vacuum about half as often.

There's this body wash you can get from the dollar store, I accidentally didn't shut the lid tight one night and it tipped over. When I woke up the next morning my bathtub was coated in the stuff, however, after rinsing it away the areas that it was left to sit were cleaner than that bathtub has ever been the entire time I've lived in that house. Now I just buy a bottle of that stuff instead of bath cleaner.

Hemorrhoid cream can be used to treat cold sores. Might want to use a brand new tube though, or it'll give you a shitty appearance.
