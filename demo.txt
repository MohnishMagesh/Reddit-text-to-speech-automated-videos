We were at least 5 days away from land and our ship was covered bow to stern in praying mantis. Not truly the weirdest thing ever, but after not seeing much life for a few weeks it was an experience for sure.

An Owl. 300 miles offshore. I hoped it would stay with us or get close enough to catch, but it flew off into open water. Lots of land birds get stuck at sea, sometimes they accidentally fall asleep on a ship and wake up in the middle of the ocean and try to find land again. Some get blown out from storms. They eventually drink too much salt water and die. The smaller ones get eaten by seagulls. It's sad.

I have only spent about 2 months on the water, with about 2 weeks on the Great Lakes. But even just a couple miles off shore in the Atlantic when it’s a foggy and calm night I totally get what sailors talk about when they say “sailing off the edge” sometimes it looks like the water just stops and there’s nothing after it.

Strange lights in the sky and water. Usually it's just a shooting star or some sort of bioluminescent sea creature.

Whales doing ballet in the bay. Hilarious to watch such a massive and heavy beast come flying out of the water over and over again like it's just playing, meanwhile it's big enough to just crush me instantly.

Solo night watch on a sailboat delivery.  New moon with overcast skies. The strangeness wasn't what I could see but rather what I couldn't. Total silence on a broad reach, surfing down long unbroken swells. No light in the sky, almost no perceived movement, just 4 hours of nothingness. Occasionally a wavelet would crest and reflect the light of the navigation light and cast a pale green flash that was the only reminder that I was on the ocean and not cast into an endless void. It was the most unsettling experience I've ever had.

Seeing humpback whales surface right beside you unexpectedly is pretty weird if you aren't used to it, especially when they're larger than your boat.

Dolphins taking turns surfing in waves behind my sailboat at night. I could clearly see the phosphorescent trail of them surfing down the wave and going between my rudder and keel. More than twenty individuals with the most amazing trails through the water.

One time on the coast I saw a massive storm stretching as far as you could see, which is of course very far when you have nothing obstructing your view...There was lightning everywhere I cant put it into words, every city was probably getting a lightning strike per minute, but from my point of view with this massive panoramic view, there must have been 10 bolts of lightning per second, sustained over at least an hour, absolutely mesmerizing..Like any good mariner, I grabbed my cigarettes, and did the ol' one foot on the railing and watched

I was on a fishing boat heading for Ross Sea in Antarctica, and two times we got fully stopped, dead in the water and completely surrounded by ice. White as far as the eye could see (which is a lot on a clear day). Turns out it was a thin layer of superficial ice that forms some times, and after a few tries (and a couple hours) we moved on, but it was pretty scary at the time. Moving forward through the ice was quite weird too...Another fun one was the largest school of dolphins I've seen, in the Pacific out the coast of Peru. Easily in the hundreds...A swarm of large squid (large as in about a meter tops, nowhere near a kraken) at night. That was off the Peruvian coast too...&#x200B;..A trio of sea lions swimming alongside the boat (a small one off the Uruguayan coast), breaching in synch over and over like dolphins...And a whale (probably a minke) breaching not two meters from the board...Man, I miss fishing boats. I have so many fond memories...Edit: fixed a sentence

the green flash. I was a photographer on a Cruise ship cant remember what Caused it but I assume it is predictable because I was invited up onto the Bridge to watch it.

I live in Michigan and we have the great lakes. These lakes contain huge shipwrecks and fish so big that people can't believe they aren't from the ocean. Lake Michigan freezes in the winter near the beach to wear people can climb the ice but it freezes in weird ways. It looks like giant frozen waves and small ice caves. Sometimes ice spheres form as the winter starts and thousands of ice balls just wash up on the beach...There are countless real horror stories and just as many ghost stories about the lakes...The strangest thing I've personally seen, I believe, is that giant ice wave effect and people swimming in freezing temperatures. I've seen massive ships visit from the ocean that make you sit there in awe at how deep these lakes must be for those to function here...Many people die and go missing in lake Michigan every year. There are unpredictable currents that can pull people under and most people here are taught how to best deal with these situations but it still can pull you out into extremely deep waters where it is likely you cannot get enough energy to make it back to shore.

My dad and I used to go boating in the Gulf of Mexico to go fishing. We were way out when my dad caught a rope. He pulled it for seemingly ever until we found a wooden box on one end. The box was a trap filled with stone crabs (normal enough) but we couldn’t find another end of the rope, the trap was very worn, and the crabs seemed to be newly caught.

Not on the ocean, but whirlpools and drains in the middle of lakes absolutely terrify me. There’s something about them that are so foreboding and menacingly

Was motoring through hurricane Irene (captaining a 32' charter catamaran) between Anegada and Jost Van Dyke in open water many miles from any coast/harbor....and stumbled upon a local man with NO BOAT doing "deep sea spear fishing". Dude had a 4x1.5 foot Rubbermaid container attached to 2 bouys filled to the brim with ice and fish. Probably at least 300 lbs of deep sea catches (before gutting). And all he had was a rudimentary, blacksmithed, iron spear rigged with silicone tubing on a stick for the propulsion. ..Why the F are you spear fishing in the open ocean during a hurricane, and how the F did you spear all those you wizard?!?!?!..We scooped him up, gave him a ride, and then enjoyed an enormous bounty of fresh deep sea fish with the fellow. He must have given us 20-25 lbs of his catch when we scooped him and gave him a ride to Jost Van Dyke...Saw the dude later on, getting off his dingy at Pusser's bar with plenty of fresh catches for the tourists. ..Dude was chill, poured us some of his homebrew rum and open fire grilled us some local chicken. Was bomb af. Never learned his name.

I was on the helms just before period of darkness when one of the stars expanded from a dot to a flower shaped orange thing that rotated very slowly. That thing was there for the whole night. probably an astronomical phenomenon..update: I realised that many people, myself included are curious about the orange thing I saw. I don’t believe in alien spaceships, still sticking to the theory of astronomical phenomenon. .I googled ‘orange light in sky’ [This](http://paranormal-corner.blogspot.com/2010/08/bright-orange-lights-in-sky.html?m=1) Is the closest thing that i found. Imagine that, but rotating very slowly. Rotation aside, it has no vertical/horizon motion. I know the blog page says UFO lol but I am just trying to show a depiction, perhaps the image could ring a bell in someone’s head (:

Physically seeing a ship and confirming it on radio, talking to the captain, then 10 seconds later, looking up and it's gone. Do a radio check, and nobody knows the call sign or what ship I allegedly talked to. ..Also, we got caught on the edge of a tropical storm and I was observing it with binoculars while my uncle and grandfather dropped the last crab cages, water tornados (Sea Devils) are fuckin scary. ..Edit: stuff added, both events experienced on my uncle's fishing boat

In Slovenia, whilst on our research vessel, we saw a pale and bold thing *almost* emerge from the sea, it looked incredibly humanoid (as in its head was poking above sea level,  with a thin layer of water over its head). It was there for a split second, and we assumed it was a diver trying to scare us. Lo and behold, we carried out a biodiversity assessment in that very area and found nothing apart from some smaller fish. But no *man*...To this day, me and my marine biology professors have no idea what it was, and how it got there (I was majoring in marine biology at the time)...We named this species as *baldus* *manius*

Was fishing with my grandfather and in prince william sound alaska, we pulled into a small bay for the night and as Im about to fall asleep I hear strange grunting comming from the shore. Almost shit my pants when it started. Grandpa heard it to so we pulled out a flashlight and shone it at the source. It was two blackbears mating.....

Father used to sail yachts for rich bastards across the Atlantic so they could have it in their Mediterranean and Florida houses depending on the time of year. His first time he got to truly see an open, unmolested starry night, and says he was appalled that it was so unusual to him, and because we’re all living in cities everyone’s missing out on that kind of natural beauty that almost every other human in history would’ve had access to.

I've spent about a full year, in total, at sea. Never have seen anything "strange" as in something I couldn't explain...Probably the strangest experience was the one time - only once, ever - that I was on a fishing boat and the skipper just turned the engine off for the night. We just...drifted, while two guys slept and one stayed on watch...The silence and the sound of the waves on the boat - it was peaceful, yet disconcerting...Edit: That boat also had a message, written in accumulated cigarette soot above a bunk, from a guy who had drowned a few years back. Just shit-talking one of his buddies, who happened to still work on that boat when I was on it. Nobody ever erased it.

Sailing towards Costa Rica, spring 2012, 2am, extremely dark night, looking over the side we saw bio luminescent plankton outlines and trails of the dolphins 8 or 9 feet below the surface that were cavorting beneath the boat. It was quite a scene.

Icebergs that look like they’re 1 million feet tall and/or floating in midair and/or upside-down (Fata Morgana). I truthfully don’t know how early sailors didn’t lose their gd minds. Can’t trust your eyes.

You’ll get flying fish occasionally land on the deck of the ship and flop around a bit until they die. When I was a very young and green cadet on a tanker in the GOM our Boatswain grabbed one of the alive ones off the deck, looked at me and said “flying fish are good luck” then proceeded to bite the fishes head clean off and spit the head overboard. All while maintaining eye contact, and casually spitting out the scales like they were sunflower seeds. Worth mentioning hat this man was the largest man id ever met to that point in my short life. Picture Terry Cruz but not as lean and with a Cape Verde accent. Probably the saltiest/strangest thing I’ll ever see, but I’m constantly surprised by nature.

Okay I read a reddit post where this dude mentioned a helicopter dumping bodies during the night when he was fishing. The captain of the ship was like,"dang they never dump that many bodies"..&#x200B;..Please someone find it

Went on a trip from Hull to the Netherlands on a phat yacht several years ago (I was doing the sailing, not being sailed, im not a ponce dw)..Ofc the North Sea is known for its oil/gas..What i found strange and almost creepy was the sheer amount of mostly abandoned oil rigs, just scattered about, some relatively close together as well. .I remember being able to see roughly 13 of them around us at one point...Edit: this was almost a decade ago now I think about it, the situations probably worse now

Well, not strangest, but, probably, the scariest. My grandfather was working in the Soviet fleet, when they tested nukes, he was there when Tsar-Bomba exploded, too. He says that there were violent waves and everything was shaking. (They didn't see the nuclear explosion, but the consequences were horrific). I may ask him for more of his army stories, because he is quite old right now (he's 80)

Back in the 1980's I was sailing around the Philippines and I was becalmed one morning about 10am. There was no land in sight. The water was as flat as mirror. Within half an hour everything turned yellow, the sky, the sea (possibly a reflection of the sky). I couldn't see where the horizon was. There was no funny smell, no wind, I couldn't see the sun - nothing, just yellow. It really weirded me out..It stayed like this for about an hour and then just sort of slowly dissipated. I thought it might have been a sand storm but there was no sand on the boat or on the water. It wasn't a fog either.

It was around 1989/90. I was out on the water off the coast of Florida anchored with a bunch of other boaters who were all waiting around to see a fireworks display. We were on a fairly small speed boat and the kids were getting bored and tearing around. My youngest son was standing on the back deck, feet in the water, when I heard him yell "Look Dad! Dolphins."..It wasn't dolphins. It was sharks. Lots of them. They aren't new to me, but I'd never seen so many fins at one given time in the ocean. I don't know if it was just the mass of boats/noise that drew them or if someone in the group was chumming and intentionally drawing them over. I remember thinking they looked like great whites but it was dark and there are plenty of other sharks in those waters.

some really long black thing that floated up to the surface of the water. The only thing I could think it was would be a submarine.

We were sailing our fishing boat out at night when a whale swim past... then a coastguard Blackhawk helicopter flew past and dropped people onto said whale... it was a drug sub painted like a whale

Generally the strangest thing out at sea is sailors that have been at sea a few months...

I worked on a research vessel, we once trawled up a prosthetic leg a few days off land. I always wondered what happened to the person who that leg belonged to... did they lose it overboard while fishing? Were they also attached to the leg in the water at some point? The mystery of the leg still sticks with me 5 years later

A whole-ass dead cow, belly-up with its hooves in the air...We were probably about 700 hundred miles south east of Kauai with a clear radar to the horizon all day so no idea where it came from. And there’s enough sharks in around it wouldn’t last that long...QMC and Boats had like 28 years of at-sea time between them and both agreed it was “one helluva thing”.

Been at sea for 3 years now, In the South China Sea I saw some lights closing in and couldnt see anything on the radar. I was about to have a heart attack because those lights were closing in REALLY REALLY FAST. I went onto the bridge wing where I could take a 30m jump into the water as I was certain we were about to collide with some HUGE piece of i dont what.. with lights. It was when it flew barely 1 meter off the bridge I realize it was an aircraft with a really strange shape.. maybe a drone.. i really don't know. I still don't know why it was flying so close to the water.

I was on a Frigate making way from San Diego heading to Hawaii.  One of the look outs spotted what appeared to be a small island off in the distance.  The Captain decided to investigate.  We pulled alongside what was a very large dead whale.  What was memorable was the hundreds of sharks visible in the water, tearing huge chunks out of the carcass.

Two for me:..2008 in the Atlantic. A wall. Our deck was 60 feet off the water and the wall was easily 30 feet off the water. It can from  nowhere. Not on a chart, not on anything. We saw it on radar and approached slowly to inspect. Not sure what ever came of as we went back to doing gator squares waiting to refuel. Easily 30 feet high and miles long...2010 Atlantic: fog. Endless dog that layed down on the ship while in transit. It was so thick you would get soaking wet from it on the smoke deck. Couldn't see outside more than 5 feet. The blowers in the engineroom sent it inside and we had to turn them off. I went to a mooring station to look out and it suddenly disappeared. We just drove out of it into a perfectly clear sky. Not a cloud all the way to the horizon...Bonus: the nights sky. It's fucking incredible un molested by light pollution. You see exactly why humans wanted to find a way to map it, zoom in on it, discover it. It's mind blowing to view. I mean really really puts you in your place in the universe.

Wow. I might win this one. I was doing drug patrolling operations and some smugglers had tried to sink their boat when we showed up but it had too many bales of cocaine to sink. We arrested the smugglers and then shot the boat but the bullets would only penetrate a few feet into the bales. This thing wouldn’t sink. A bunch of whales were curious about what was going on so we stopped shooting at the boat because we didn’t want to harm them at all. We rammed the boat at slow speed with our ship and it broke in half and sunk, except for the bales of cocaine. Which have bullet holes in them and now the whales are playing with them. And I had to go down in a boat and get the bales of cocaine away from the whales, who were now enjoying themselves a lot more than they were a couple hours ago. That was a long day. ..TLDR: whales on cocaine

So. Many. Flying. Fish.  ..And its just sort of eerie being in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, just absolutely nothing in any direction, and many stories up, knowing you'd just vanish forever if you somehow fell in.  ..And how crazy big some storms and waves get.  ..Never saw anything otherworldly or mythical or anything, but your eyes can def play tricks on you in that sort of environment.

I’m not a mariner or anything like that, but I did see something peculiar - waves. Not just any old waves though, they were in a grid. I was standing in a grid of waves, so I got scared as fuck and ran because I had a real bad feeling about it. I asked the lifeguard what that meant and he immediately got everyone out of the water because grid waves mean serious riptides which can be dangerous for boats too.

Once sailed across the  mid atlantic gulf stream. From the deck of the carrier you could see the abrupt change in the water from a deep blue to a more hazy bluey green. Like someone put a line in the ocean.

At sea off Christmas Island, north of Australia. On warship HMAS Sydney, saw a shooting star kind of object moving across the sky, it was so bright it lit the sky up an electric blue, Kind of like a a electric blue day light. And it was moving rather slow compared to a shooting star. It was most of the way across the sky and it turned 90 degrees or bounced off the atmosphere or something. ..All the crew on watch in the bridge with me were all absolutely stunned and not a single one of us had ever seen anything like it. It was scary, awesome and burned into my memory. Especially the blue colour

Sounds simple but really thick fog at night time...its just black out the window. Difficult to describe, its like your sailing into the void...Bio luminescence is cool too. It looks like the whole ship is floating on a glowing blue cloud. Only seen it that strong a few times though...Flying fish, really common but freaky as fuck.

After spending several seasons commercially fishing alaskan waters, every season brings new and strange things seen and heard ..One time i was sitting on deck at sunset gazing out and i heard what must have been a massive splash behind me and i turned around to find completly still water with no ripples for miles to be seen. None of the other 3 dudes on board heard a thing..Also i was driving directly into the brightest sunrise i have ever seen for about 3 hours strait and i swear my eyes were so shot i thought i saw a great old ship like a sloop or a caravel flaming on the horizon...Its little odd things that are just real enough to really make you a little spooked

When hurling through Indian ocean, after my duty gets over...usually I will go and lie on the open deck to look at Milky way and shooting stars...And few times, I have heard wailings of women and colorful dancing lights also which will be there for a brief amount of time! Once they became routine, it didn't bother me anymore

A cargo ship at night, dimly lit, that did not answer any radio calls. We technically had right of way as a sailing yacht and wanted to contact them to make sure we had a plan. In the end we adverted course as we did not want to crash...It felt like a ghost ship, but I like to assume that they just didn’t have someone on the radio. ..I also saw a red moon rise on the open ocean. It was eerie but beautiful. I’ve never seen the moon look so big or so close since.

I’ve seen a few strange things at sea, most of which have been mentioned already. The weirdest experience is something I felt: a suspicious gut-turning uneasiness (not sea sickness), like how people describe a haunting I guess. I’ve felt it before in New Orleans. This instance was felt sailing across the Philippine Sea from Guam to Singapore via the Sulu sea. It only lasted an hour or so, but it just felt like “somethings here” unsettling vibes. In reality we were the only ship in eye sight or on radar. Eight months later when they found the wreckage of the USS Indianapolis, I realized that’s the approximate area we sailed through.

This is something I was told from a guy who supposedly experienced this firsthand (its still as sea story, so feel free to take it with a mount of salt)...Supposedly, on the USS Stark (it was hit by an Iranian missile back in the 80s.)  That missile caught them with their radar down, and the first indication it was happening was the forward lookout calling it in.  Missile drills the bosun's locker, killing everybody inside. (This is as recounted to me in the story, anybody who knows better can feel free to correct me)...And supposedly, according to this guy, in the middle of the night, you can still hear them.  Bullshitting, drinking coffee, that sort of thing. Not unhappy, not in pain, but like they never realized they're dead, and they're just having the morning bullshit session, forever...EDIT: In freaky news, I didn't even realize that the USS Stark was hit on this day (May 17th) in 1987.  Does this add to the weewoo?

I was working on a commercial fishing vessel (fisheries biologist) and there was a fire in the engine room. We put it out but we were dead in water ~200nm south of Panama City, FL in the middle of August. Fellow fishermen towed us in, took 2 days. We slept on the deck and because we had no lights on we could see every star possible. It was so clear you could also see satellites moving across the sky...The stabilizers were still down when we lost power, about 15-20 feet down and at night you could see them clear as day because of the bioluminescence.

Came across distressed mariners in vessels taking on water a couple times; hours, maybe minutes from disappearing into the deep.  Occasionally you’ll find an empty vessel adrift.  Makes you think how many you just missed or couldn’t discern from the waves or see at night.

i think everybody would say this but, a singling ship, i was once on a sailing trip with my friends across the pacific and at the end of the trip we saw (near shore) a boat that looked like it was sinking. my friends and i just thought someone was hulking their ship but, better safe then sorry, when we got near we saw people on board! so obviously we pick the up and drive them to shore, well the entire time we where asking them questions, like "why didn't you send a distress signal or radio for help?" they said that they where new to sailing and that was their first trip. ok, but, like, didn't you take a class or review a book before going?! ok that's it, they got through saying they where hulking

Probably Saint Elmo's fires are the spookiest, especially considering the thunderstorm around you and the fact that they indicate that a thunder is about to hit your ship.
