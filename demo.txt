“There’s always someone out there who has it worse” - while possibly true, it trivializes the serious struggles that people go through. Sure, someone could be going through worse, but that doesn’t invalidate what you’re going through.

"Just kidding!"  When you catch someone red handed doing something they shouldn't, and they dismissively say, "just kidding" as if it never happened and they're thus absolved of everything.   It drives me up the wall.  At least own up to it!

In America (where I live), people constantly say “It’s a free country” as an excuse for saying or doing something that other people are judging/criticizing them for.  What they fail to realize is that it goes both ways and they’re not free of the consequences of their actions.

*God will provide* and other synonymous phrases in response to a frustrated comment or complaint...I'm not looking for divine intervention.

"They're in a better place"  I get that it usually comes from a sincere place but sometimes it is just tone-deaf.  I think my friend who accidentally wrapped his car around a tree would argue he was in a just fine place before.

“It’s just a phase.” Say that to all the people who committed suicide because of this “phase” called depression and crippling anxiety. It’s not a phase. A lot of people are suffering but aren’t taken seriously because of people who fake their depression. It’s not okay. If you fake a mental illness, stop it. Because you don’t have depression, you most likely have a factious disorder and you need to seek someone out. And if you don’t have a factious disorder and fake depression for internet points, you’re an asshole, I hope you know that.
