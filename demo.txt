If someone is in trouble and you want to leap in to save them, make sure you have a way to get out yourself. I recently saw a video of a drowning man. Another man jumped in to try and save him. Instead both drowned

If your car goes into the water, open the door or roll down the windows immediately. If you don't, the pressure differential will hold them shut and you'll have to wait until the car fills up with water...Edit: a lot of people are telling me that on newer cars, the headrest poles can be used to break a window. I'm not sure if that's true, because headrests I've seen are just made of ordinary steel, and the ends aren't particularly pointy. A dedicated window breaker will have a sharp point made of an ultra hard material...Does anyone know if newer headrests are actually made for this?

This is a New Zealand specific one, but all emergency numbers work here. The official number is 111. But 999,000,911, etc. will all work. This is so that tourists can still reach emergency services easily.

"There are no rules if a stranger puts their hands on you"..Yell, scream bloody murder, kick, bite, make the biggest scene you possibly can and run away as fast as you can. ..Make sure your kids understand that this is the exception, the time they MUST draw as much attention as possible and do ANYTHING it takes to get away and get help.

Maybe not your life, but someone else's. Most drowning is silent. The victim quite literally cannot speak to call for help, as they are too desperately trying to get any air at all. Drowning can look simply like a person bobbing in the water until they no longer come back up. Keep a watch out. Especially if it's kids.

If you’re being tied up, puff yourself out as much as possible so it’ll be easier to wiggle out of. Tense muscles, inhale deep and stretch out your arms and legs to make more space.

Do not delay getting out of a burning building. The flames are not what will kill you. The smoke will get very thick and toxic very quickly and you will not be able to see the way to get out.

If you get impaled or stabbed leave the object in and call 911 (or your country's equal) That object is keeping all the blood on the inside of your body.

If you ever almost drown to the point of throwing up water or passing out, even if you feel 100% fine, get to a hospital. Your lungs can unwittingly self-fill up with fluid over the next few hours.

If you are ever buried in rubble (earthquake, tornado, building collapse etc). ..Don’t shout. You’ll lose your voice and waste energy. ..Instead, grab a piece of rubble and knock in patterns of threes. Humans are expert pattern makers and pattern notices. ..Rescuers will hear the distinctive pattern sound and go toward it. ..Once you can hear people, then use your voice.

If you get kidnapped try to leave as much traces of yourself behind as you can. For example leave bits of clothing behind or scratch your arms a lot to leave dead skin behind. This way you increase your chances that a search dog could pick up your sent and find you.

Maybe not your life but possibly others...In an emergency situation pick 1 person to specifically call 911.  In lots of stressful or emergency situations there are significant delays in calling 911.  Some people assume that others will call 911 while other panic/freeze up and dont think to call 911...If you're faced with an situation where 911 is necessary, pick a specific person to contact 911.

I read somewhere if a stranger gets in your car and tells you to take them somewhere drive into something like a lamp post or anything. You wont be useful to them anymore because the car is damaged and you've drawn attention to them by crashing the car. You'll damage your car but you'll have your life and your bank account. Someone at my college did this a few years ago, the guy told him to drive to the bank and withdraw all his money so he drove into a lamp post and saved himself.

.Never pull out a gun or any weapon unless you are prepared to kill or die. Weapons escalate the situation to another level. If you have a weapon, intend to use it and risk having it used on you.

If you are buried in an avalanche, you won't be able to tell which way is up. You should spit. Gravity will carry the spit down. Dig the opposite way so you can escape.

Not for yourself, but someone else. First aid in general is not meant to be the only form of aid a person receives. If you give someone CPR, or use a defibrillator on them, or they have a severe allergic reaction requiring an EpiPen, you should still call emergency services immediately - these are just temporary measures to buy time until a medical professional can treat them more thoroughly. Similarly, chewing aspirin for a suspected heart attack still requires emergency services to treat the issue or rule out complications.

This one’s pretty obvious, but if someone’s grabbing you, it’s usually easy to break the hold by grabbing their thumb. Can’t hold shit so well without your thumb...I’m glad I haven’t had the opportunity to use this next one, but I’ve been taught that if someone is trying to assault you or kidnap you, and you manage to get him on the ground, prop his leg up on something (kneecap facing upward) and fucking JUMP on that goddamn knee. Can’t chase or kidnap you if he can’t fucking walk.

When you’re in Australia (mostly on beaches) DO NOT TOUCH THE TINY ADORABLE OCTOPUS WITH BLUE RINGS it’s poisonous and will usually kill you. In fact, don’t touch any snakes or spiders or marine life, a lot of it is poisonous, venomous or will kill you in other ways... don’t let this stop you from coming to Australia though, most of the humans are pretty nice.

If you're visiting an unfamiliar location like a cinema or concert hall, take a few moments to look around for the nearest exit, then pick out a second as a backup in case the first becomes blocked or cut off...If something happens, especially in a crowded public place, most people's first instincts are to turn around and head for the main entrance but this is not always the closest, safest or easiest way out.  Nine times out of ten there will usually be a closer exit.

If you need to call 911 and you're too busy helping the victim (CPR) specifically point at someone and say "you! Call 911!" Instead of "somebody call 911!" It snaps a person out of bystanders effect and they act.

If you’re lost in the wilderness and need something sharp to hunt/defend with, make a spear by hardening a soaked branch/stick over a fire.  The water prevents the stick from burning, but the heat from the fire forces the branch to condense and harden making them more durable.

You can perform the Heimlich manoeuvre on yourself..Put your dominant fist above your belly button. Wrap your other hand around the fist. .Drive your first in and up into your diaphragm hard and repeatedly until whatever your choking on dislodges..Re swallow your food after chewing it some more cause that burger was 6.99 and you ain’t gonna let the man take you out

Not life saving BUT fkn useful. If you have a splinter and cant get it out; cut off a tiny piece of new soap put over where it is and put plaster/bandaid over it. Next morning peel off the plaster and whatever the splinter is, is stuck in the soap.

If stranded in the wilderness without food, do not eat Mushrooms as a food source. 90% of them will kill you or make you violently ill. and some species of poisonous mushrooms imitate or look nearly indistinguishable from edible ones. So unless you are a mycologist, the fungus are not fun-guys in a survival situation

never ever ever place an extension ladder on a smooth concrete floor and climb it unless the feet have rubber pads attached to them. otherwise there is a very real risk that as you climb higher, your weight will cause the feet to slide out from under you because there is very little friction between aluminum and smooth finished concrete. I've climbed ladders countless times and then one day I did this and it almost killed me. Shattered my wrist and almost broke my back. Life forever altered.

If you're caught out in a thunderstorm, do not, for the love of god, stand under a tree for shelter. Had a kid at our school get killed like this - lightning hits the tree, travels down to the ground, up one fluid filled leg, through the heart stopping it, down the other leg into the ground...Get somewhere that is safe like a car or if you really need to squat down on the the floor with your feet together until it passes. Don't waste time ditching gear like jewelry. Easy way to tell the distance of the storm - count from the flash to the thunder, divide by 5 for miles, and three for kilometres (roughly)...If you're caught up a hill, take EXTRA precaution and preferably plan ahead and just don't go if there's a chance of lightning.

Speaking with first-hand experience, North Korean border guards will search your belongings when you are going into the country. If you want to sneak something illegal in (eg South Korean movies), hide them in a pillow...At least that's how I managed to do it. ..Actually, just don't go to North Korea. Trust me.
