Mid to late twenties. Feeling like I'm way behind from where I should be by now.

Being retired, the two things that really suck are:..1.  Watching good friends pass away yearly..2. Having to push through the aches and pains of old age to do the things you enjoy.  But I realize that I'm luckier than many of my friends who have had hip, knee or shoulder replacements or open heart surgery.

I'm 29...5 couples from my friends circle are expecting a child or recently got married, a few others have built a solid foundation in their career and are buying houses (most of us grew up in apartment buildings, so it feels fancy to own a house at 30 where I'm from)...Meanwhile I'm currently a student and broke...It feels like everyone's so far ahead in life that they'll always be a step further and I'll never catch up.

Once your friends start getting married and having kids, shit becomes lonely.

The early 30s is that weird age where you're just old enough to be out of touch with what's cool, but not yet old enough to be fully progressed in your career to be sitting on enough stacks to not care about that...Getting there at least.

I'm too old to take up most action sports (the body doesn't bounce back like it used to,  that shit's real) and too young to retire and just fuck off all the time.

I'm 25 and the whole existential dread of figuring out what to do with my life is probably the worst part of things

When you finally understand what ~~Mark Twain~~ meant when he said “youth is wasted on the young”...Edit: quote is from George Bernard Shaw (or maybe Oscar Wilde)

When I was late teens to mid twenties I used to make fun of my dad cause his not being able see  to read small print news paper etc... ecause letters were blurry. He would ask me "Steve read that for me it's to blurry" . I come out and say to him "what's the matter to old your eyes can't make out small print"  His reply be "you just wait  you fucker get my age you will go same shit " Well some 15 or so years later I had some blue prints out on table (concrete construction I do) had some details I couldn't make out so I " Jessie come here can you tell me what that's says " and I be a motherfucker my son's reply was " you getting to old dad can't read that" that moment years back of me telling my dad pop up and thinking if what my dad told me going happen to me one day. He was just saying that he is okay not to forget bout him from the grave. Love you pops I'm sure your eyesight is better.

Old enough to start to hurt and ache, but supposedly I have another 30 years of productivity in me.

I'm not sure if this happens with all people my age, but I'm 18 and people (specifically my parents and close family members but not limited to them) will use the "you're 18, you're legally an adult you need to be doing these things on your own" whenever it will work in their favor then immediately go back to "you're still just a teenager/you're still my kid" whenever I try to be even the slightest bit independent.

At 73 I am reminded daily... by my body... that I’m not 25 years old anymore.

What sucks about being 30-ish is: now you actually HAVE TO make important decisions you were putting off (like changing career etc)

Being 21. Feel pressure to save money before I move out on my own (bills, rent, textbooks, tuition, etc.) [went to community college, paid tuition, and lived at home]. Still very hormonal despite not being a teen anymore and I’m horny and depressed all. The. Time. At least I can drink...Edit: just wanted to thank all of you for the great advice. I appreciate it so much!

Dulled emotions. Being a teenager had some very low lows but the highs also felt higher. Now I’m in a constant state of apathy.

I have a perfectly clean driving record and over 6 years of never missing an insurance payment, but the  monthly insurance bill is more than my car payment...I've been to 15 different places. It all ranges from 200 to 350 a month and ill lose my liscense if I cant afford it working 9 an hour. I lose my car. I lose my job and apartment.

Nearly sixty...I forget things all the time. Easy to remember old things, hard to remember new things. I once loft my card in an atm twice in one month. all my passwords have to be written down somewhere, as do the birthdays of my lids...I constantly get fatter, even though I don;t eat any more...I haven't had regular sleep patterns for 20 years...Every day I'm a little more tired.

The panic is beginning to set in about what I'm going to do with my life.  I also can't stop looking back on decisions I've made that drastically altered my life for the worse...I'm not old, but I'm at an age where I'm wondering what I'm going to do with the years I have left...Recently I wrote out a 10 year plan for where I want to get to, because at this point my entire endgame is to end up with a smile on my face in the later years of my life.

I wouldn’t change being 41 for anything but new aches and pains all the time definitely make it suck.

You're too young to do things, bc everybody finds you like a stupid child. Nobody pays attention to your opinion. You just exist. You don't live. You exist. That's terrible for a person like me, bc I wanna do stuff, I wanna work, I wanna study the things I like, I wanna talk with elder ppl, but that's difficult

I’m between the age of getting your driver’s license and being a legal adult. ..17 is just purgatory for privilege

Sucks not being old enough to drink and not young enough to call yourself a teen

dumbolddoor

Not a physical thing but more of a phycological  enlightenment in my 30 and realizing how hard being an adult it and everything my parents did for me to succeed. At my age now - they already had two young kids running around - meanwhile I forget to buy dog food and don't know how to do my taxes.

Being around people that are in their late 30s or 40s feels like I'm not really an adult, but talking to their teenage kids makes me feel like I'm 100 years old...

49 year old here. The menopausal hot flushes etc are not a problem but putting 4 stone in weight on in 8 months is fucking awful
