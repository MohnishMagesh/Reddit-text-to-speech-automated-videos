What is the most effective psychological “trick” you use?

Doing something you’re avoiding by just doing the smallest possible step, like washing one plate. It cracks the procrastination paralysis and you usually end up doing the whole thing anyway.

Predictability means safe.

I’m a school teacher with a high number of students with trauma. Major issues while getting my routines established, but they’re now super warm to me because I’m reliably predictable.

I have two outfits that I alternate, a mon/wed/fri and a tue/thurs. Same greeting at the start of class, same start to every class etc. Have very transparent discipline too, they know exactly what gets a detention and what doesn’t

If they can predict what will happen, they feel safe because they’re in control of choosing their outcome for the day.

I think it's called the "hairy arms" trick. When I'm about to hand in the first version of a piece of work, I will leave a small but noticeable error that's easy to fix. It's always the error that my boss notices and suggests changing, which means that he/she feels involved in the process but also doesn't nitpick for something arbitrary to criticize.

“If they can do it, I can do it”. Almost every single job,position, title or accomplishment has been achieved by someone that other people look at and go, “how the fuck did that moron make it to where he is?”. And if those morons can do it, I sure as shit can do it as well.

Talk softer so people either de-escalate or pay more attention.

Remember people's names.  Greet them by it when you see them, even if that's the only time this week you might.  People really like it when someone remembers them.  It's easy credit.

I’m a salesman who is afraid to call. Really it is like a phobia. In my job you mostly hear a no than a yes and it makes me feel down. So recently I run into this technique when you have to take  a “no” for your goal, each morning I write 70 circles, each time I hear “no” i color it and this shit just works. Somehow your brain rewards yourself for a no and you don’t feel like shit. Also I never sounded so confident. I’m not afraid to offer anything, I want this no. My results have never been this great so far. I want to use this method in regular life also.

You can remind yourself to do any task by leaving a random object in the middle of the floor on your way out of the room. When you come back in you'll see the object and remember why you left it there. Works every time

Fake it till you make it can really trick yourself into doing something you didnt want to do.

For example, I really don't feel like starting on my report, let me just pretend that I'm interested in doing it, look over the data and act like I was getting any information out of them. And then next thing I know I was balls deep into my report.

I wouldn't call it a trick, but empathizing with someone goes a long way. If you can explain their perspective back to them in a way that actually proves you understand it, you have a much better chance of getting them to listen to your perspective.

The human brain can usually differentiate between a fake polite smile and a genuine one.

So I just put myself in my golden retriever’s mind when meeting new people and I can feel my face light up like “OH BOY NEW PERSON! FRIEND FRIEND FRIEND.” 

I’ve gotten better service at places and free stuff.

If you tell someone you need their help, they are more likely to do what it is you want or need, rather than you telling them to just do it.

---

"Hey Little Jim, when you get done dinner, I need your help in the kitchen."

Little Jim: "Okay dad"

Shows up, tell him you're loading the dishwasher, put a couple of plates in and he'll help and then thank him after.

**or**

"Little Jim, after dinner you need to do the dishes."

Little Jim: "Fuck off you old cunt."

Big difference.

Illusion of choice. Instead of saying you need to wash the dishes, ask if they'd rather wash dishes or do laundry, or give a choice of time. Do you want to do the dishes now or in an hour? It makes a lot of people's brains skip the big answer which is None of those.

Ben Franklin effect - if someone doesn't like you, convince them to do you a favor or lend you something. It'll trick their subconscious into convincing them they like you. Very handy at work.

Silence. It's so powerful. If I want to find out more about what someone is really thinking or feeling- instead of nodding along or using some verbal filler, I just don't say or do anything. It's amazing how people respond. So often as people we interrupt each other before things reach a deeper level. Plus, some people find silence uncomfortable and need to fill it. I've found out so much this way.

At work, when I know something is not working due to a mistake that someone else has made, I ask them if I’ve done something wrong or if I understand the process correctly. I find more people are willing to own up to something and fix it quickly if they are not made to feel defensive with direct accusations.

I don't know if it's effective yet but I'll try to make myself believe that my due dates for college assignments are one day before so I can pressure me and finish them on time

I literally gave my classmates treats so that they would stop being bullies. It actually worked.

Edit: gave them a treat every time they did something nice. I even did a survey for a class exercise to see what everyone's favourite lollie was.

"Help me to understand" (Or some variation thereof.) 

I work in an office and while I hate 99% of the dumb corporate buzzword kool-aid that gets passed around, I honestly feel like that phrase has a lot of merit.   


On a daily basis I'm having to collaborate on projects,  pick up where someone left off, and in some cases fix an problem another co-worker caused. It's really easy to start treating differences in procedure or simple human error as malicious or lazy when you're neck deep in it for 40+ hours a week.

"Why did you do it this way?" or "what's the point of this?" may be more direct, but I found it puts the other party on the defensive and they spend more time trying to avoid making me upset than actually reaching a resolution. 

Asking them to collaborate and help me to understand how a decision was made or why a process was done the way it was is much more collaborative and productive. 

As an added bonus I sometimes get a good insight into an unexpected solution that I wouldn't have thought of and my co-workers don't see me as a growling ogre they can't come to for help.

Ladies and gentlemen! A personal favorite of mine is the speak softly method (patent pending) 

If you end up in an argument and the other party is yelling, tone down your own volume slowly. 

Dont speak too softly too fast or you'll be seen as weak, dont be too loud for too long or your back to where you started, just lower the tone of conversation down to an acceptable level. 

Maintain a calm and collected demeanor and in no time at all your yelling match will have turned into a more or less amicable debate where you can resolve the issue.

(P.S. If you want to grab someone's attention via email, comment, etc, paragraphs are key. No one likes reading long blocks of text. Keep it short to begin and then people will be hooked so you can make the paragraphs a little longer.)

When someone is on their phone, you can hand them anything and they will 100% hold it for you :D

Ya anything.

After I woke up I opened the fridge to eat my ice cream but it has been eaten. I immediately knew it was my brother. If I asked him did you eat my ice cream? I’m sure he gonna deny lol but what I did is, I told him I bought you an ice cream, go eat it, then he immediately said I already eat it! And you know what happened to him after...

Dealing with kids is all about distractions.

If a kid is fussy, describe the area of an invisible device that you installed that prevents fussiness. Go into detail about how you installed all the latest features -- and specify the edges and corners.  -- confusion will occupy a kid's attention.

Doesn't want to eat -- that's a challenge race -- focus on the competition, not the food.

"I'm bored" -- ask them if chopping off their toes will help with boredom.

Incentives are how you sell the product.

Not sure if it’s a trick but I can ask my SO to do something a million times, and the answer will always be “Later.” But if I say, “Ok. Don’t worry about it I’ll go do it.” he will do it immediately.

One of the best ways to defuse a conflict while also getting what you want from a person is to compliment them, telling them that they are the qualities you want them to start being in that moment, and then they will usually begin to start acting like it all. The idea of a compliment throws them off and makes them want to listen more, and then the things you said which they are not will bother their ego and they will usually try to start acting like the way you complimented them for being because to not do so would prove you wrong and they would feel foolish. You can literally trick their own ego against them. This is also a great way to make enemies like you more. I've made enemies into friends using this trick.
