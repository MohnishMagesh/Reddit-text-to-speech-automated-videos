What is the most effective psychological “trick” you use?

Doing something you’re avoiding by just doing the smallest possible step, like washing one plate. It cracks the procrastination paralysis and you usually end up doing the whole thing anyway.

I think it's called the "hairy arms" trick. When I'm about to hand in the first version of a piece of work, I will leave a small but noticeable error that's easy to fix. It's always the error that my boss notices and suggests changing, which means that he/she feels involved in the process but also doesn't nitpick for something arbitrary to criticize.

“If they can do it, I can do it”. Almost every single job,position, title or accomplishment has been achieved by someone that other people look at and go, “how the fuck did that moron make it to where he is?”. And if those morons can do it, I sure as shit can do it as well.

Predictability means safe...I’m a school teacher with a high number of students with trauma. Major issues while getting my routines established, but they’re now super warm to me because I’m reliably predictable...I have two outfits that I alternate, a mon/wed/fri and a tue/thurs. Same greeting at the start of class, same start to every class etc. Have very transparent discipline too, they know exactly what gets a detention and what doesn’t..If they can predict what will happen, they feel safe because they’re in control of choosing their outcome for the day.

The human brain can usually differentiate between a fake polite smile and a genuine one...So I just put myself in my golden retriever’s mind when meeting new people and I can feel my face light up like “OH BOY NEW PERSON! FRIEND FRIEND FRIEND.” ..I’ve gotten better service at places and free stuff.

You can remind yourself to do any task by leaving a random object in the middle of the floor on your way out of the room. When you come back in you'll see the object and remember why you left it there. Works every time

I wouldn't call it a trick, but empathizing with someone goes a long way. If you can explain their perspective back to them in a way that actually proves you understand it, you have a much better chance of getting them to listen to your perspective.

Fake it till you make it can really trick yourself into doing something you didnt want to do...For example, I really don't feel like starting on my report, let me just pretend that I'm interested in doing it, look over the data and act like I was getting any information out of them. And then next thing I know I was balls deep into my report.

Remember people's names.  Greet them by it when you see them, even if that's the only time this week you might.  People really like it when someone remembers them.  It's easy credit.

If you tell someone you need their help, they are more likely to do what it is you want or need, rather than you telling them to just do it...---.."Hey Little Jim, when you get done dinner, I need your help in the kitchen."..Little Jim: "Okay dad"..Shows up, tell him you're loading the dishwasher, put a couple of plates in and he'll help and then thank him after...**or**.."Little Jim, after dinner you need to do the dishes."..Little Jim: "Fuck off you old cunt."..Big difference.

Illusion of choice. Instead of saying you need to wash the dishes, ask if they'd rather wash dishes or do laundry, or give a choice of time. Do you want to do the dishes now or in an hour? It makes a lot of people's brains skip the big answer which is None of those.

I’m a salesman who is afraid to call. Really it is like a phobia. In my job you mostly hear a no than a yes and it makes me feel down. So recently I run into this technique when you have to take  a “no” for your goal, each morning I write 70 circles, each time I hear “no” i color it and this shit just works. Somehow your brain rewards yourself for a no and you don’t feel like shit. Also I never sounded so confident. I’m not afraid to offer anything, I want this no. My results have never been this great so far. I want to use this method in regular life also.

Ben Franklin effect - if someone doesn't like you, convince them to do you a favor or lend you something. It'll trick their subconscious into convincing them they like you. Very handy at work.

Silence. It's so powerful. If I want to find out more about what someone is really thinking or feeling- instead of nodding along or using some verbal filler, I just don't say or do anything. It's amazing how people respond. So often as people we interrupt each other before things reach a deeper level. Plus, some people find silence uncomfortable and need to fill it. I've found out so much this way.

At work, when I know something is not working due to a mistake that someone else has made, I ask them if I’ve done something wrong or if I understand the process correctly. I find more people are willing to own up to something and fix it quickly if they are not made to feel defensive with direct accusations.

I literally gave my classmates treats so that they would stop being bullies. It actually worked...Edit: gave them a treat every time they did something nice. I even did a survey for a class exercise to see what everyone's favourite lollie was.

"Help me to understand" (Or some variation thereof.) ..I work in an office and while I hate 99% of the dumb corporate buzzword kool-aid that gets passed around, I honestly feel like that phrase has a lot of merit.   ...On a daily basis I'm having to collaborate on projects,  pick up where someone left off, and in some cases fix an problem another co-worker caused. It's really easy to start treating differences in procedure or simple human error as malicious or lazy when you're neck deep in it for 40+ hours a week..."Why did you do it this way?" or "what's the point of this?" may be more direct, but I found it puts the other party on the defensive and they spend more time trying to avoid making me upset than actually reaching a resolution. ..Asking them to collaborate and help me to understand how a decision was made or why a process was done the way it was is much more collaborative and productive. ..As an added bonus I sometimes get a good insight into an unexpected solution that I wouldn't have thought of and my co-workers don't see me as a growling ogre they can't come to for help.

Ladies and gentlemen! A personal favorite of mine is the speak softly method (patent pending) ..If you end up in an argument and the other party is yelling, tone down your own volume slowly. ..Dont speak too softly too fast or you'll be seen as weak, dont be too loud for too long or your back to where you started, just lower the tone of conversation down to an acceptable level. ..Maintain a calm and collected demeanor and in no time at all your yelling match will have turned into a more or less amicable debate where you can resolve the issue...(P.S. If you want to grab someone's attention via email, comment, etc, paragraphs are key. No one likes reading long blocks of text. Keep it short to begin and then people will be hooked so you can make the paragraphs a little longer.)

After I woke up I opened the fridge to eat my ice cream but it has been eaten. I immediately knew it was my brother. If I asked him did you eat my ice cream? I’m sure he gonna deny lol but what I did is, I told him I bought you an ice cream, go eat it, then he immediately said I already eat it! And you know what happened to him after...

One of the best ways to defuse a conflict while also getting what you want from a person is to compliment them, telling them that they are the qualities you want them to start being in that moment, and then they will usually begin to start acting like it all. The idea of a compliment throws them off and makes them want to listen more, and then the things you said which they are not will bother their ego and they will usually try to start acting like the way you complimented them for being because to not do so would prove you wrong and they would feel foolish. You can literally trick their own ego against them. This is also a great way to make enemies like you more. I've made enemies into friends using this trick.

One that I picked up from a friend of mine whenever he was trying to pick out dinner with his gf: rather than ask "What do you want?" and getting the typical 'i dunno, anything' answer and then having suggestions shot down. Start with "what do you NOT want?"..Used it a few times in some of my relationships and it's the godsend question.

If I want someone to agree with me for whatever reason I'll subtlety nod my head while asking them a yes or no question. It subconsciously primes them to agree.  The trick is more potent if you get them to agree 2 or 3 times to really simple and obvious questions before the question you want them to agree to most.  ..I use this trick for up-selling at work all of the time.  It works dangerously well if I use some nonverbal communication too.

Dealing with kids is all about distractions...If a kid is fussy, describe the area of an invisible device that you installed that prevents fussiness. Go into detail about how you installed all the latest features -- and specify the edges and corners.  -- confusion will occupy a kid's attention...Doesn't want to eat -- that's a challenge race -- focus on the competition, not the food..."I'm bored" -- ask them if chopping off their toes will help with boredom...Incentives are how you sell the product.

Placebos work even when you know it's fake medicine you are taking. So I just convince myself that water cures pain. ..https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/placebo-can-work-even-know-placebo-201607079926..You can also use this on others. .Basically, if you want to help someone that's complaining about having a headache and you don't have a painkiller. You just whip out a convincing speech about how most headaches are due to dehydration and loss of salt. Make sure to say you read Harvard research about this and just sit back and watch as a glass of water with salt starts to act like medicine. Works 9/10. And it works better if you are exact about it, like one pinch of salt per 100ml...It's all about the theatrics and grabbing attention. They call this the lab coat effect. People expect certain things from medicine. Trust through scientific research, exact ratio's and a foul taste are very much part of this...True story, read about this in a Harvard journal.

"Ok, well I gotta get going, talk to you later!" Then walk away. Most people don't know how to react when you suddenly decide your done with a conversation and leave...It works exceptionally well on people who will just keep talking. If you hard end the conversation, the brief silence will give you time to leave/hang up/drive away. Is it rude? Maybe. Is it effective? Yes.

When I am discussing something with coworkers, where I need help from them and they present arguments why they cannot provide help, I keep silent after they finish explaining why they cannot provide help. It gets kinds of awkward for them, and 9 times out of time, I get what I need.

Here's one I pull on the idiot customers at work:  ..If they're buying a pack of, say, Game or Dutch cigarillos and they ask for a different pack because the one I grabbed felt "stale" to them, I'll pretend to put the package I originally grabbed back into the box and that I'm grabbing a new one, but in reality I'm just grabbing the same pack they just said they didn't want. They'll "inspect" it and will be happy because apparently it's no longer stale, even though it's the same exact pack...

I work with a lot of people, and quite often they think that they somehow know better how my job is done. So, what I usually ask if they complain is "How would you suggest doing it then?" and if they give me an irrational suggestion or something that's simply not possible, I ask them something along the lines of "And how do you imagine me doing this?" This is usually the point where they realize that their ideas are probably not the best guidances when it comes to something they don't work with.

When you want to find out information I always say, ‘I don’t want to make you feel like you need to tell me, so say it at your own pace’ and I do actually mean it. I don’t want to force them into telling me, but they usually tell me eventually, and they say it in more confidence or detail because they came to me on their own terms

I have 2. .First, active listening. I work with the public and have to make favorable connections quickly. I've found people will quickly open up to you if you act genuinely interested in what they have to say...Second, and sneakier: figuring out how much of a sociopath the person you're dealing with is. When you apologize, add in something that showcases vulnerability or weakness. (i.e. I'm really sorry that I upset you so much)  people lower on the scale will focus on the apology. People higher on the scale will focus on a percieved slight.

When I'm walking in a crowd of people  .(Not nowadays obviously) and I see that I'm about to walk into someone going the opposite direction, to avoid the awkward side to side shuffle, I try to look past the person walking towards me instead of at them. This somehow makes the other person turn and walk around you instead of into you.. I love doing this with people who seem to have too big of an ego to ever change their path for someone else. If I don't acknowledge their existence, they have to get out of my way

I'm a supervisor in the military; most of the people I supervise are 19-23 years old and still trying to figure life out. Imagine how you were at that age, we have the same issues. Anyway, "fake it until you make it" is all well and good until you have to handle millions of dollars in assets or process a lot of information, understand it, and relay it. So as a supervisor and trainer, I have to ensure that my very young trainees who are trying to 1. not get in trouble and 2. trying to impress me complete understand what they are doing. So, my psychological trick is the Socratic method; at any time they try to bullshit an answer, I will double my questions which forces them to either double down and dig their own grave or admit they don't know. I'm cool with people not knowing, we can address and train that. I am not cool with fakers...This also works with political debates as well, "why do you think that?" "Why do you suppose that?" "What brought you to this conclusion?"

Saying ‘thanks’ rather than ‘please’. ..As a teacher I use this on small things like instructions when I don’t want to argue with students. It’s amazing how much more effective the sentence “Get out your book thanks” is compared to “Get out your book please”. It implies that there is no conversation or option for the students. ..That and “It is great to see so many people with their book out ready to start learning”. I have said this when only 10% have their book out and everyone rushes to get their book out. Everyone wants praise and to be part of the group.

If you’re playing rock-paper-scissors, you say a couple of choice words before you throw down. ..* “My defenses are **solid**. You can’t **smash** me in this game. You will **crumble** against me.” - They will be more likely to throw rock. ..* “I will **cut** you down. My strategy will **slice** through you like a **knife**. - They will be more likely to throw scissors. ..* “I am prepared for this battle, I **covered** all of your options. I see through your **brittle** strategies.” - They will be more likely to throw paper. ..From what I can tell in my research, this has worked successfully at least 33% of the time.

If you have set a boundary with someone but they keep puahing, go silent. For example, if you have said that no, you cannot attend Christmas this year (for whatever reason) and no matter how much you repeat yourself, you get a 'but why' or some other pushback, blank them. Go silent, give a neutral facial expression and do not engage. The silence will get awkward bit stick it out and most of the time, they will change the subject.

Smiling at people makes it easier for them to treat you nicely because it's hard for someone to smile at you and you not smile back. People have always treated me with kindness in public and I put it down to me smiling and being nice. Most people are nice, so if you're nice to them then they're nice to you.

Sometimes it works to pretend you don't notice someone trying to bully you. I've learned in high school, sometimes the best response is to treat the person like a ghost. But if they know you reacted to it and notice it, it's already over lol.

Word anything "negative" into terms of "not positive". Subconsciously, your brain doesn't listen to the "not" and imagines what's negated...My favourite example of this is [making a tightrope walker fall for the first time in their career, simply by telling them not to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTO94wJXQoc).

Whenever you want someone you’re with to hold an object you’re holding but without giving them the opportunity to reject it, start a conversation about something that has to do with them and wait for them to be telling you about it excitedly and then keep starring at them as you sneakily hand over whatever you’re holding and they won’t interrupt their story telling to refuse what you’re giving them. Voilà! Got rid of something you didn’t want to hold.

As a salesperson, getting the customer to buy extra shit by directing their gaze. Like I would ask "oh, and do you need any x today?" while deliberately looking in the direction of that item. The customer instinctively follows my gaze to it and ends up buying it after seeing it. This trick works way better than just asking if they'd like to buy something else.

If someone is being obstinate and just will not calm down or constantly complaining, I just take a deep a breath and say "what is it that you want?" ..It throws them off their rhythm every time I've done it or someone I know uses it. It confuses them and they shift gears and it descalates. Most of the time they just want to feel heard and like they're getting their way. 9 out of 10 they just want to throw a tantrum and it becomes apparent quickly so they back down. Its very disarming:.. I look calm and rational and anything other than constructive statements makes them appear petty. If they cant come up with an answer, than why are they upset?

Dead Air. I’m comfortable with silence and will use it to make people continue talking long past when they should’ve stopped or when I would normally respond. Just not responding cues the person’s brain to assume they didn’t fully communicate the thought, so they help by going on. ..I don’t mind appearing slow, so it’s a fine “trick”.

During a 1:1 conversation with someone, and you want them to reveal more information that you could either use to 1) understand them better; or 2) gain the upper hand in a negotiation, just keep quiet. ..Eventually, your counterpart will be so uncomfortable with the silence that they'll start talking and sharing information that they may not have been comfortable sharing in the first place. ..I lead a team of 5 and have used this many times before. Works like a true charm! ..PS. Got this from a book called Never Split The Difference by Chris Voss, who's an ex FBI negotiator.

Say I'm wrong when I know I'm right with my wife. Defuses  countless fights and maintains relationship. Being hung up on being right is toxic. As long as I know I'm right, it's all good...Also, thanking my wife for doing any small thing around the house i.e. emptying dishwasher, making the bed, cleaning a mirror, etc. It costs nothing and makes the other person feel appreciated, which boosts their positive emotion towards you, even though they are the one that did the harder thing...Edit: Well, you dont have to always say you're wrong if you're are not. But the point is, you dont have to call the other person out for being wrong and demand they admit you are right. That never really works ever.

Being nice and polite and very passive to get people to do what you want...Works really well in public/shopping situations, if I phrase requests very nice when I ask for something I know someone isn't supposed to do and then use a little passive reverse-psychology ("No, it's ok, I understand if you can't do it") I can almost always get someone to do what I want as a "huge favor."

Rock, paper, scissors trick. Just before you play, pretend to clarify the rules with the other person by asking:.. "OK, is it One-Two-Cut?, or One-Two-Three-Cut??"..Doesn't matter what the answer is, but more often than not they'll throw scissors because you've said "cut" (so if you throw rock, you'll win)...Sounds silly, but try it a few times and you'll see!

Once I got called in the director's room(in a college), he looks at me as he wants to eat me. As a senior who knows that he'll bully student who looks weak, I look him straight in the eyes n didn't blink at all while he talks. After he finish, I'll say okay and I look him in the eyes while saying "do you have anything else to say?". He looks nervous and just chuckle to ease himself, and when I'm at the door (about to get out from the room), he shouted at me some gibberish I didn't hear. I immediately turn around and ask "what did u say?", he just shook his head and said nothing.so I went to my class and one of my classmate who is also inside the room said that the director said Im a cold hearted girl, and looks like idgaf on what he said...So yeah, if someone wants to bully or just messing with you, try not to show your fear. In this case, the director just messing with me because he's a bit jealous of me (that's what my lecturer said). ..That's one of the effective trick that I still use to this days

How to exude confidence 101:..When talking to people, look at a point right between their eyebrows. You won't get anxious about eye contact. 9/10 times, this will make the other person start to fidget and get a bit uncomfortable...Sit back in your chair, back well rested on the back of the chair. The proverbial "sitting at the edge of your seat" makes you look too eager, desperate, or anxious. The added benefit is that keeping your back straight puts less pressure on your diaphragm. You can breathe in fully and control your voice a lot better. 9/10 times, it will make the other person lean forward and get a bit uncomfortable.

The illusion of choice. I work with clients who have varying degrees of brain injuries, disabilities, and mental health diagnoses and there are many instances where they are either unable to make the choices that benefit them or to fully understand those choices. However, they’re adults and like us all they want to feel in control of their lives, which can be hard when there’s constantly staff around. So I offer guided choices as much as possible so they still get to decide and feel in control while making safe choices. I use this a lot with mealtime (do you want chicken and broccoli or ham and peas), medications (do you want to take them now or after we go for a walk), doctors appointments (would you like a morning or afternoon appointment), and so many other things. It turns out to be a win win!

I don't really use it but it's a very nice trick..Let me explain you, you can buy a phone and you have the choice between the first version, wich cost 400$ and has 64gb, and the second version wich cost 900$ but has 200gb. You'll say "I don't need so much space memory, let's the the 400$ one".But then, you notice that there's a third version with 110gb for 800$. Let's resume..A Version : 400$, 64gb.B version : 900$, 200gb.C version : 800$, 110gb..Here's the trick, you'll say "For only 100$ more, i can get 90gb more ! Well, let's go for the C version"..I don't know if i explain it good (Sorry for my bad english i'm french)

If you really want to mess with someone’s day, I have three:..1. Only ask them questions when they have taken a BIG bite of their food. It’s really awkward for them.2. If you’re sure they won’t know it’s you, while they’re walking past you, in the opposite direction, say WAKE UP in a loud voice. To take this a step further, put sticky notes with WAKE UP written on them all over places where they’ll see..3. If you want to make someone’s bad day even worse, while consoling them, say, “You know, despite what everyone says about you, you’re a great person.” When they repeatedly ask you what everyone else is saying, just say phrases like, “Oh, no. It’s ok. It doesn’t matter what they say.” Or quickly end the conversation.

Ask for something not acceptable and when it's rejected, ask the real request.

I ask people an either-or question with one of the things that I want to do and one that I know they do not want to do. More often than not what I wanted gets picked.

when you tell people about your motivations, ideas, and plans, you'll actually LOSE motivation to do them...so tell nobody and you'll find yourself easily being motivated

It’s called the “door-in-the-face” route of persuasion, and it goes like this:..“Mom, there’s going to be a party tomorrow night. Can I go till 3AM?”..“Of course not! Why would I let you do that?”..“Okay, could I stay till 11PM?”..Make an unrealistic request, watch the other person say no, and ‘reel back’ to a more reasonable request-the one you intended in the first place.

In my line of work I meet a lot of people daily and I need to socialize and have people remember me. (Or at least did before the Covid-19 happened..) .Every time when I’m introduced to a new person, I make sure I compliment them somehow in the first 15 minutes. I like your hair, cool shirt, wow you’re really good at x and y. I make it something casual and easy, genuine, nothing too personal, but something that I think they would appreciate. This usually leaves a nice memory imprint of our first encounter, and they are more likely to remember me, and have a positive attitude torwards me in the future. .It’s simple, and you get better at it over time. And the fun thing is that even if they are your opponent, you force yourself to find a positive thing about them and it creates the first connection for mutual respect.

When talking to one or more people that you want to convince, nod your head in a "yes" movement or shake in a "no" movement, at the same time that you are telling them the thing you want them to (dis)agree with. Subconsciously, they will interpret these gestures as if the thing you are saying is commonly accepted, and will buy what you're saying

54321 - 5-second rule via Mel Robbins. Have the motivation or urge to do something? Count backwards 54321 and MOVE. It works...Also The Work by Byron Katie. Any belief you have that causes you suffering, ask the 4 questions: Is it true? Are you absolutely sure that it’s true? Who would you be without this thought? And then turn that thought around and find 3 examples of how those turnarounds are true. it’s fucking insane. Works like a charm. Highly recommend her books. Simple and SO effective. ..Example: ..I am a terrible person...Turnarounds:..I am not a terrible person (then find 3 examples of how this is true).My thoughts are terrible.People are terrible to me.I am terrible to myself ..And so on. Usually there are 3 turnarounds but sometimes more...Edit:  this works exceptionally well when your suffering is from “someone else.” Then you do the work on them and generally find out you’re causing your own suffering.

As someone is talking to me, I will continue to look them in the eyes, but not say anything. They will keep talking and talking, telling me more without my asking.......or at least that’s how it’s happened to me when someone just stares at me after I get done talking.

Delay replying to people if I'm annoyed, angry, or in a hurry

Normally when people want something from me, mainly my family I’ll distract them from what they actually wanted to ask because I know I can’t provide. <I’m only a teen but they ask me for things such as money or my snacks that I keep to myself> normally when I can’t provide they get angry. So when I know they’re coming to me for something they want I distract them because they don’t have the best attention span and they forget all about what they wanted.

Saying you need someone's help is much more effective than telling them they are required to do something.

Me at work .."_____, do you have a full butt?"..He/she: ??..Me: "Well do you?"..He/she: "I guess so..?"..Me: "Then why do you half ass everything?"..Usually that is proceeded with fixing if the problem and keeping the mood light lol

Had a boss that always rejected the (obvious) solutions our work crew had collaborated on and decided was best. So as a group, we would pick a second impractical idea and suggest it. He almost always then settled on the best solution we wanted, with a little nudge here or there. It was amazing to see a crew of 6 guys all work this same con to get the job done right.

One thing that I’ve learned to do is to “disassociate” from whatever unpleasant task I know needs done. It’s like watching someone else do the task in my body or watching a mundane part of a t.v. show, so no disgust or frustration or boredom, whatever, it just gets done, the end. I do NOT recommend it with anything involving other people that expect engagement.

I found this one out organically. If someone, like a boss for instance, needs to select a person for something, you can greatly alter your chances either way by either looking preoccupied and avoiding eye contact or vice versa depending if you want to be selected.
