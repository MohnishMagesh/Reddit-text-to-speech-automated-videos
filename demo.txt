Telephone calls. Telephone call at 3pm you think, "ugh telemarketer." Telephone call at 3am you're thinking "fuck fuck fuck, someone died."

When the suicidal friend send you a pretty lengthy message. It is scary during the day too but waking up in the morning to read that literally destroys all your emotions and put you in a panic fueled scared state.

Windows and gaps between things. You look through them for long enough, you start to feel like you're *about* to see something move, and if it sees you as well, you're in danger. But of course, you know that there's nothing right outside your window. There's nothing between the trees on the other side of the road. There's nothing that could suddenly beeline for you, right?

Some years ago I discovered that for me its flying. I've flown a lot in my life. Starting very young. I'm annoyingly happy and excited when flying during the day. I had a night flight from Minneapolis to Phoenix. I had a panic attack while flying for the first time. I looked out the window and just completely lost it. I cried nearly the entire flight.

Your apartment buildings front door's glass shattering from inside to out.  


This happened some time ago. I was sleeping and suddenly pop, crash, and shatter. I live just above the door so I got to experience it in it's full glory.  


So anyway. I go check it out. Then I called the cops and the maintenance number. Then the neighbour next to me came to check it out too, and we wondered about it in the dark of night.  


The downside of living above the lobby that I hear all the strange things that happen in there and at the front yard. I guess there was a reason why this apartment used to be the caretaker's apartment.

The woods, years ago at my grandma's house in the country-side, chatting with my older brother and some cousins, maybe 3 am, pitch black outside, we heard what sounded just like someone throwing rocks at the tin roof, probably by the dozen, 1 every 2 seconds or so, there's no way something fell on the roof, wasn't a branch or something laying on the roof, nothing, the only logical explanation is rocks, my uncle went out to look, obviously saw nothing.

The scariest thing is, the only people close by are good neighbors, and it's about a 10-20min walk, and there wasn't even moonlight.

Horses neighing. 

I live VERY near Churchill Downs (happy supposed-to-be Derby Day). It’s very unsettling to be in the middle of the city at night on the porch smoking a cigarette and hearing distressed horses.
